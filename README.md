# Python-Game-Development
The game I have created resembles that of the classic Atari game PONG:


GAME INSTRUCTIONS
You may be required to install python turtle, the import for this is:
pip install PythonTurtle

Launch the game by using CTRL + Enter on the main block of the script
The game will start after the ball has created a line in the center of the screen and returned to the middle.

CONTROLS:
Player - RED - To move the paddle up = W
             - To move the paddle down = S

Player - BLUE - To move the paddle up - 'up arrow'
              - To move the paddle down - 'down arrow'

DISCUSSION:
I would have liked to have included an instruction menu that displays before the game starts, as well as a score limit of 5, which once reached displays "RED WINS" or "BLUE WINS" and then asks the player if they would like to play again.

However, I ran into some problems after creating the code, whenever either part was implemented into the code, the game would stop responding. After doing some research I discovered on stack overflow that Python Turtle takes up a lot of memory when running, so I believe that the laptop cannot handle any more code so it therefore had to be excluded.
